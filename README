Dramatic fork of the leanModal.js jQuery plugin by FinelySliced.

Initialize modal by simply calling it on a jQuery object.
Example: $('.modal).modal();

CSS:
#curtain {
    position: fixed;
    z-index:100;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    height:100%;
    width:100%;
    background: #000;
    display: none;
}

Currently the only way to close the modal is by putting <div class="close"></div> within modal html. Set CSS styles appropriately. Option to close by clicking curtain and ESC key to come.


Change notes: Name change to jquery-modal, cleanup of code and curtain fades and modal transitions. Top value is now dependent on modal height. Scrolling is prevented on window when modal is opened.

More documentation to come in addition to more function options.
